# Noise Reduction Code

This repository contains Python code for performing noise reduction on audio signals. The code utilizes the `noisereduce` library, along with other dependencies such as `librosa`, `soundfile`, and `scipy`.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following packages:

- `noisereduce`
- `librosa`
- `soundfile`
- `scipy`

You can install these packages by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Please make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/noise-reduction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd noise-reduction
```

3. Run the `noise_reduction.py` script:

```
python noise_reduction.py
```

4. The script will process the audio file located in the `input` directory and save the denoised output in the `output` directory.

## Example

To demonstrate how the code works, an example audio file is included in the `input` directory. You can replace this file with your own audio file for testing.
